# Contract Event Analysis Summary

**Generated:** 2025-08-18T15:17:00.000Z

## Executive Summary

The analysis reveals significant discrepancies between the current subgraph schema and the expected new KaiSign contract events. The new contract introduces 8 new events, modifies 1 existing event, and removes 2 obsolete events.

## Key Findings

### 1. Current State Analysis
- **Contract Events Found:** 5 (from current contract source)
- **Schema Entities Found:** 5 (matching current contract)
- **ABI Events Found:** 5 (but with 1 signature mismatch)
- **Critical Issue:** ABI file contains new contract signature for `LogCreateSpec` while source code still has old signature

### 2. New Contract Requirements Analysis
- **Expected Events:** 11 (from new contract specification)
- **Missing in Schema:** 8 new events need to be added
- **Modified Events:** 1 event (`LogCreateSpec`) has significant signature changes
- **Obsolete Events:** 2 events (`LogAssertSpecInvalid`, `LogAssertSpecValid`) should be removed

## Detailed Differences

### Missing Events (Need to Add)
1. **LogCommitSpec** - Commit-reveal pattern implementation
2. **LogRevealSpec** - Reveal phase of commit-reveal pattern
3. **LogIncentiveCreated** - New incentive system
4. **LogIncentiveClaimed** - Incentive claiming
5. **LogIncentiveClawback** - Incentive recovery
6. **LogContractSpecAdded** - Contract specification tracking
7. **LogEmergencyPause** - Emergency pause functionality
8. **LogEmergencyUnpause** - Emergency unpause functionality

### Modified Events
- **LogCreateSpec**: Changed from `(address indexed user, bytes32 specID, string ipfs)` to `(address indexed creator, bytes32 indexed specID, string ipfs, address indexed targetContract, uint256 chainId, uint256 timestamp, bytes32 incentiveId)`

### Obsolete Events (Should Remove)
- **LogAssertSpecInvalid** - No longer emitted by new contract
- **LogAssertSpecValid** - No longer emitted by new contract

## Impact Assessment

### High Priority Issues
1. **Schema Incompatibility**: Current schema missing 8 new events
2. **Event Handler Gap**: No handlers for new events in subgraph mapping
3. **ABI Mismatch**: Current ABI has mixed old/new signatures

### Medium Priority Issues
1. **Obsolete Entities**: 2 unused entities in schema
2. **Contract Address**: Needs update to new deployment address

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **[CRITICAL] Update ABI File**
   - Generate complete ABI from new contract deployment
   - Replace `graph/kaisign/abis/KaiSign.json`

2. **[HIGH] Update GraphQL Schema**
   - Add 8 new event entity definitions
   - Update `LogCreateSpec` entity definition
   - Remove obsolete `LogAssertSpecInvalid` and `LogAssertSpecValid` entities

3. **[HIGH] Update Subgraph Configuration**
   - Change contract address to `0xA2119F82f3F595DB34fa059785BeA2f4F78D418B`
   - Add event handlers for 8 new events
   - Update existing `LogCreateSpec` handler

### Implementation Order

1. **Schema Updates** (Task 2 in implementation plan)
2. **ABI Generation** (Task 3 in implementation plan)
3. **Subgraph Configuration** (Task 4 in implementation plan)
4. **Event Handlers** (Task 5 in implementation plan)
5. **Testing & Validation** (Task 6 in implementation plan)
6. **Deployment** (Task 7 in implementation plan)

## Generated Entity Definitions

The analysis tool has generated complete GraphQL entity definitions for all missing and modified events. These definitions include:

- Proper type mappings (Solidity → GraphQL)
- Required fields with appropriate nullability
- Standard subgraph metadata fields (id, blockNumber, blockTimestamp, transactionHash)
- Inline comments showing original Solidity types

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk
- Schema additions (new entities)
- Obsolete entity removal

### Medium Risk
- Event handler implementation
- Subgraph configuration updates

### High Risk
- Contract address change (affects indexing)
- Modified event signatures (breaking changes)

## Success Criteria

1. ✅ All 11 expected events have corresponding schema entities
2. ✅ ABI file matches actual contract deployment
3. ✅ Subgraph successfully indexes from new contract address
4. ✅ All event handlers process events without errors
5. ✅ No obsolete entities remain in schema

## Files Generated

1. `contract-event-analysis-report.json` - Detailed current state analysis
2. `new-contract-analysis-report.json` - Comprehensive new contract analysis
3. `scripts/analyze-contract-events.js` - Current contract analysis tool
4. `scripts/new-contract-events-analysis.js` - New contract analysis tool

## Next Steps

Proceed with Task 2 in the implementation plan: "Update GraphQL schema with new and modified events" using the generated entity definitions from this analysis.
